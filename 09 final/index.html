            <p>Discover how blood donation works, and who it helps. Every blood donation can help save three lives. People of all walks of life need blood products. Some need it to get them through a serious event in their lives, like cancer or a difficult pregnancy. Others have medical conditions which mean they need blood products regularly to stay alive or be healthy.

            <p>Are you 18-70 years old (16+ for NZ), healthy and weigh over 50kg? You may be able to give blood. The easiest way to find out of you can donate is to take the "Elibility Quiz" on the Red Cross AU website.

            </p>
            <p>You need to register with your local organisation, and book in your donation. For Australia, we have a Red Cross "Red 25" donation group called "Satanic Australia". You create your account with Red25 then link your profile to "Satanic Australia". For Aotearoa, you'll be donating as an individual - but we want to know when you donated, and if you're not camera shy, flick us a selfie that we might use on our sites and social pages. Just ring: 0800 GIVE BLOOD (0800 448 325) to find the one closest to you, and set up an appointment.</p>

                <p>Not everybody is able to donate, but there are other ways to help. For this campaign, the best thing you can do is to spread word through social media, your friends or family, or your work colleagues (if you feel comfortable). Other options include registering as an organ or bone marrow donor, or by supporting your local Red Cross organisation.

            <p>Satanic Australia’s mission is to bring Satanic change to Australia. We aim to achieve this through activism – fighting for church/state separation, freedom of expression and bodily autonomy. This involves issues such as access to euthanasia, removal of religious instruction in public schools, and to ensure women have access to voluntary abortion. We provide the opportunity to meet with other freethinkers, Satanists and secular activists in Australia.</p>
            <p>Satanic New Zealand provides the opportunity to meet with other freethinkers, Satanists and secular activists in Aotearoa New Zealand. We would like to facilitate the communication and mobilisation of politically aware Satanists, secularists, and advocates for individual liberty. We are a non-theistic religion and do not believe in a literal Satan; rather to us he is a potent symbol of rebellion against religious tyranny.</p>
